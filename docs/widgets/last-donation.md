### How to get someone's Participant ID

1. Go to [extra-life.org](https://www.extra-life.org/)
2. Navigate to the person's participant fundraising page
3. Copy the Participant ID out of the address bar. It is the number after "participantID" and should be at the end of the address. See example image

### How to configure custom messages and sounds for Incentives

1. Enter the Participant ID(s) into the `last-donation-settings.js` file
2. Open the `incentive-config.html` file in your web browser
3. Copy the text from the page and replace the `incentives: {}` line in the `last-donation-settings.js` file with the block displayed
	```
	âš  Everything from "incentives: {" through the "}" on a line by itself at the bottom
	```
4. Remove incentives you do not want to treat differently from a normal donation (All 4 lines in the following example.)
	```
	"C37CACA4-0CFB-D042-B9A1543222BA4943": {
		"incentiveText": "Widget Test Incentive 1",
		"incentiveSoundList": ["ExampleSound.ogg"]
	},
	```
5. Add sound(s) to the incentives you want sounds for ("ExampleSound.ogg" is a placeholder), and customize the text if desired

Here is an example of an incentive with custom text and a list of sounds to choose from randomly:

```
"C37CACA4-0CFB-D042-B9A1543222BA4943": {
	"incentiveText": "Do a Little Dance!",
	"incentiveSoundList": ["ExampleSound.ogg", "Fanfare.wav", "Towel.mp3"]
},
```
